# GenOsc
Remember using a Function Generator and an Oscilloscope on your school..? 
Do you miss tinkering stuffs again for fun? You can do it again! You only need a working brain(ofcourse), proper computer, program(GenOsc), an Arduino and a signal amplifier.

The program itself works as an Arduino controller where it gives command to output signals as a Function Generator that you usually see on your School Laboratory(might be older than you) but you do need a simple circuitry first to amplify those signals(coming from Arduino) to create different waveform you want(pre-embedded on GenOsc) while simultaneuosly receiving data from the Arduino input to which I made a series of code to interpret the input data on a x-y line graph and will function similarly as an Oscilloscope(I did used Zedgraph library for the Wave graphing technicalities)
