# GenOsc
Remember using Function Generator and Oscilloscope on school? now I made it on your computer by creating this program and having your arduino attached on your computer, you might as well need a signal amplifier and some basic circuit to produce/amplify the desired signals to see.

Hi everyone,

The program itself works as Arduino controller where it commands the arduino to output signals to function as a Function Generator you usually see on your Laboratory on your own School but you do need a simple circuit to amplify those signals to create different waveform you want while simultaneuosly receiving data from the Arduino input where I made a series of code to interpret the data on xy line graph to function like an Oscilloscope. I use Zedgraph library for the Wave graphing technicalities.
