# GenOsc
Remember using a Function Generator and an Oscilloscope on your school..? 
Now, I made it possible to have it on your own by just having only a computer, this program, arduino, and you might as well need a signal amplifier and some basic circuitry to produce/amplify the desired signals to see on your screen.

Hi everyone,

The program itself works as an Arduino controller where it gives command to output signals functioning as a Function Generator that you usually see on your Laboratory on your own School but you do need a simple circuitry to amplify those signals to create different waveform you want while simultaneuosly receiving data from the Arduino input to which I made a series of code to interpret the data on a x-y line graph in order to function as an Oscilloscope. I use Zedgraph library for the Wave graphing technicalities.
